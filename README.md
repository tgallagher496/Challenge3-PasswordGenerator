# Challenge3-PasswordGenerator

## Description

This project creates a random password using the user's input.  The user gets to decide if they want lower case, upper case, numbers and/or symbols in their password.  This program helped us learn about function notation, arrays, strings, if/else statements and loops.


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/ReadMePic` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    
![ReadMe Image](/Assets/ReadMePic.jpg)
